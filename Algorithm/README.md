## Shintani domains for totally complex quartic number fields 

Here we give an algorithm (in PARI GP) to obtain a fundamental domain for totally complex quartic number fields $k$. By Shintani's unit theorem such domain is a finite union of polyhedral cones with generators in $k$. 

This implementation is based in the manuscript

ATTRACTOR-REPELLER CONSTRUCTION OF SHINTANI DOMAINS FOR    
    TOTALLY COMPLEX QUARTIC FIELDS (version 2) 

by A. CAPUÃ‘AY, M. ESPINOZA AND E. FRIEDMAN, submitted to the Journal of Number Theory (2023).

## File description

(I). After uploading the file `ShintaniDomainK41.gp` in Pari GP, using an irreducible polynomial $p$ (which define a complex quartic number field), then you can use the comand 

 `F=FDK41(p);`

This returns a data $F:=[F1,F2,F3,F4]$ asociated to a Shintani domain with the following description (explained in the example file)

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first entry $F1$ (i.e., $F[1]$) has the form 

      $$[t,p,reg,disc,E,r,T]$$

with 

$t =$  real computation time for $F$ in milliseconds

$p =$  quartic irreducible polynomial defining a totally complex number field $k:= \text{the quotient ring } \mathbb{Q}[X]/(p)$ 

$reg =$  Regulator of $k$ to 19 decimals

$disc =$ Discriminant of $k$

$E =$  fundamental unit of $k$. The Shintani domain corresponds to the action on $(\mathbb{C}^*)\times(\mathbb{C}^*)$ of the 
       group generated by $E$. The  unit $E$, like all other elements of $k$ below, is given as a polynomial $g$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ 
       of degree at most $3$. The associated element of $k$ is the class of $g$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X]/(p)$
       
$r =$  minimal positive integer with $|E_1|^{2r} < 0.184$ as in display $(34)$ of Ms. Here $E_1$ is an embedding of $E$ in $\mathbb{C}$
   
$T =$    number of 4-cones in the Shintani domain constructed 

  
\item The second entry $F2$ of $F$ (i.e., $F[2]$) has the form  

      $$[\tilde{e}_1,\tilde{e}_2,\tilde{e}_3,\tilde{e}_4]$$

where $\tilde{e}_j$ (for $1\leq j\leq 4$) is an element of $k$ approximating the $j-th$ element of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{C}^2$, wherein $k$ is embedded. The elements $\tilde{e}_j$ are mentioned at the beginning of the proof of the Main Theorem in section 5 of the Ms. The error bound ($\varepsilon$ in the Ms) used was $1/150$. 


\item The third entry `F3` of `F` (i.e., `F[3]`) has the form  

      `[C1,C2,...,CT]`

which is a list of the `T` (semi-closed) cones in the Shintani domain. Here `T = F[1][7]` is the last entry of a1  described above. Each cone `Cj` is given by `m` linear inequalities (`m` depending on the cone) giving `m` closed or open half-spaces whose intersection is `Cj`. Thus, each `Cj` has the form  

  `[v1,v2,...,vm]`

where `vi=[w,1]` or `[w,-1]` and `w` is an element of `k` (depending on `i` and `j`). If `w` is followed by `1`, then the corresponding (closed) half-space is the set of elements `x` of `R^4` with `Trace(xw) >= 0`. If `w` is followed by `-1`, then the corresponding (open) half-space is given by `Trace(xw) > 0`. Here Trace is the extension to R^4 of the trace map from `k` to `Q`.

\item The fourth entry `F4` of `F` (i.e., `F[4]`) has the form  

      `[CC1,CC2,...,CCT]`

where `CCj` is the closure in `R^4` of the cone `Cj` in `F3`. Each closed cone `CCj` is given here by a list of generators in `k`.

\end{enumerate}             


(II). If you want to obtain Shintani domains for a list of (totall complex quartic) polynomials `L`, you can use the command

  `ShintaniExamplesK41(L)`

This create a file with all the Shintani domains obtained for the number fields defined by each polynomial `p` in `L`
