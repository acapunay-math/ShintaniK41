## A k-rational complex of cones for three cyclotomic number fields  

   Here we show two complex of $k$-rational polyhedral cones $S$ and $Q$ for three specific number fields, then we verify algorithmically that $S$ contains $Q$. This verification is rigorous since the difference $Q-S$ is made on the rational field $\mathbb{Q}$
  
   This README file is meant to aid in interpreting the accompanying files PCyclotomicc.txt and PCyclotomicc-ML.sage, which contains a data of three cyclotomic number fields $k$ generated by the polynomials $p=x^4+1$, $x^4-x^3+x^2-x+1$, and $x^4-x^2+1$ whose torsion group is of order $m=8$, $10$, and $12$ respectively. 
   
 The file PCyclotomicc.txt is a text file meant to be downloaded and read into PARI GP via the command

 ```bash
 \r PCyclotomicc.txt
 ```
       
It can, of course, be read and used by other software, bearing in mind that square brackets [ ] are used for lists, its elements are separated by commas. The file PCyclotomicc-ML.sage can be read by SageMath using 

 ```bash
 load('PCyclotomicc-ML.sage')
 ```
       
              
This returns the same list of examples as the file PCyclotomicc.txt and has the same structure.

## Description of file PCyclotomicc.txt:

The file PCyclotomicc.txt contains a data of three vectors. It consists of one long line of text of the form 

  $$data = [D_1,D_2,D_3];$$

ending in a semicolon (to prevent PARI GP from printing this big  file to screen). Each $D_i$ (i.e., $data[i]$ for $1\leq i\leq 3$) has the form  

  $$[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5]$$

1. The first entry $a_1$ (i.e., $data[1][1]$) has the form 

   $$[p,reg,disc,m]$$

with 

$p=$ quartic irreducible polynomial defining a totally complex number field  $k:= \text{the quotient ring } \mathbb{Q}[X]/(p)$, 

$reg=$ Regulator of $k$ to 19 decimals,

$disc=$ Discriminant of $k$,

$m=$ order of torsion group of $k$ (here $m=8, 10, 12$).

2. The second entry $a_2$ of $D_i$ (i.e., $data[i][2]$) has the form  

   $$[\tilde{e}_1,\tilde{e}_2,\tilde{e}_3,\tilde{e}_4]$$

where $\tilde{e}_j$ (for $1\leq j\leq 4$) is an element of $k$ approximating the $j$-th element of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{C}^2$, wherein $k$ is embedded. The error bound used in this approximation was $1/150$. 

3. The third entry $a_3$ of $D_i$ (i.e., $data[i][3]$) has the form 
 
   $$[C'_1,C'_2,...,C'_m]$$
 
which represents the polyhedral complex of $m$ four-dimensional $k$-rational (semi-closed) cones:
 
 $$S:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{m-1}C_j',\quad C_j':=C_j-C_{j+1} \quad (\text{ taking } j \text{ modulo } m=8,10,12)$$
 
 $$\text{and } \quad C_j:=x^j\cdot\text{Cone}[1,x,x^2,x^3].$$
    
Each semi-closed cone $C_j'$ in such list has three entries: 
    
 $$[R,H,sgn],$$
    
where
    
 $R=$ vector in $k$ which represents the generators (or Rays) of closure of the cone $C_j'$,
    
 $H=$ vector in $k$ which give a description by (linear) inequalities of the cone $C_j'$,
    
 $sgn=$ vector of signs $1$ or $-1$ of same size of the $H$,
    
 such that:
    
 If $[H[i],sign[i]]=[w,1]$ for $i=1,\ldots,\text{length}(H)$, then this corresponding to a closed half-space, that is, is the set of elements $x$ of $\mathbb{R}^4$ with $\text{Trace}(xw) \geq 0$.
    
 If $[H[i],sign[i]]=[w,-1]$ for $i=1,\ldots,\text{length}(H)$, then this corresponding to an open half-space, that is, is the set of elements  $x$ of $\mathbb{R}^4$ with $\text{Trace}(xw) > 0$.
    
 
4. The fourth entry $a_4$ of $D_i$ (i.e., $data[i][4]$) has the form  

  $$[Q_1,Q_2,Q_3]$$
      
which represents a polyhedral complex of three 4-dimensional $k$-rational (semi-closed) cones:

  $$Q=f(P^{\Delta,\Gamma}(c'))$$

where $P^{\Delta,\Gamma}(c')$ is the polyhedral complex described in the Lemma 10 (page 158) of the article: 

[ATTRACTOR-REPELLER CONSTRUCTION OF SHINTANI DOMAINS FOR TOTALLY COMPLEX QUARTIC FIELDS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X23002299)

and the map $f$ is an $\varepsilon$-perturbation of identity described in Section 4.4 of this article. Moreover we take $c'=1/10$ (instead of $c'=1$) and 
$$\Delta=\Gamma=[1,\zeta_3,\zeta_3^2]$$ 
represents triangles in $\C$ whose vertices are the unit cubic roots. 

Each cone $Q_i$ ($1\leq i\leq 3$) is given in the same form $[R,H,sgn]$ described in the previous item. 

5. The fifth entry $a_5$ of $D_i$ (i.e., $data[i][5]$) represents the difference set:

   $$S-Q$$

If $S-Q=[]$, then $Q\subset S$. Otherwise, $S-Q$ is union of $k$-rational semi-closed polyhedral cones.
